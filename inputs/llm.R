   - argument: The problem that this episode revealed wasn’t about my individual medical care; it was about a medical system that measured variables and outcomes in various places and times, conducted statistical analyses, and made use of the results in other situations. The problem had to do not just with data analysis per se, but with what database researchers call provenance—broadly, where did data arise, what inferences were drawn from the data, and how relevant are those inferences to the present situation?[@JordanPaper]
   - human critical thinking in higher education education
    -solution: new fields of study data and humanities.t we’re missing is an engineering discipline with principles of analysis and design.not just data based decision making but how?
    - another problem that is directly related to ai is that wa we considered intelligen. coes beyond just analyizing data and machine learning is exactly that, data needs higher cognitive and social understading to be applied to humans. 
    
  - but there has been progress
  
  The past two decades have seen major progress—in industry and academia—in a complementary aspiration to human-imitative AI that is often referred to as “Intelligence Augmentation” (IA). Here computation and data are used to create services that augment human intelligence and creativity. A search engine can be viewed as an example of IA, as it augments human memory and factual knowledge, as can natural language translation, which augments the ability of a human to communicate. Computer-based generation of sounds and images serves as a palette and creativity enhancer for artists. While services of this kind could conceivably involve high-level reasoning and thought, currently they don’t; they mostly perform various kinds of string-matching and numerical operations that capture patterns that humans can make use of.
  
  - Hoping that the reader will tolerate one last acronym, let us conceive broadly of a discipline of “Intelligent Infrastructure” (II), whereby a web of computation, data, and physical entities exists that makes human environments more supportive, interesting, and safe. Such infrastructure is beginning to make its appearance in domains such as transportation, medicine, commerce, and finance, with implications for individual humans and societies. This emergence sometimes arises in conversations about an Internet of Things, but that effort generally refers to the mere problem of getting ‘things’ onto the Internet, not to the far grander set of challenges associated with building systems that analyze those data streams to discover facts about the world and permit ‘things’ to interact with humans at a far higher level of abstraction than mere bits.
For example, returning to my personal anecdote, we might imagine living our lives in a societal-scale medical system that sets up data flows and data-analysis flows between doctors and devices positioned in and around human bodies, thereby able to aid human intelligence in making diagnoses and providing care. The system would incorporate information from cells in the body, DNA, blood tests, environment, population genetics, and the vast scientific literature on drugs and treatments. It would not just focus on a single patient and a doctor, but on relationships among all humans, just as current medical testing allows experiments done on one set of humans (or animals) to be brought to bear in the care of other humans. It would help maintain notions of relevance, provenance, and reliability, in the way that the current banking system focuses on such challenges in the domain of finance and payment. While one can foresee many problems arising in such a system—privacy issues, liability issues, security issues, etc.—these concerns should be viewed as challenges, not show-stoppers.
- Second, and more importantly, success in these domains is neither sufficient nor necessary to solve important IA and II problems. On the sufficiency side, consider self-driving cars. For such technology to be realized, a range of engineering problems will need to be solved that may have little relationship to human competencies (or human lack-of-competencies). The overall transportation system (an II system) will likely more closely resemble the current air-traffic control system than the current collection of loosely-coupled, forward-facing, inattentive human drivers. It will be vastly more complex than the current air-traffic control system, specifically in its use of massive amounts of data and adaptive statistical modeling to inform fine-grained decisions. Those challenges need to be in the forefront versus a potentially-distracting focus on human- imitative AI.
- how can we train critical thinking ai if we as humans still lack from it. the creation of ai and ii is just a reflection of our nature. so from this rreading the extent to which we should let data speak for themselve is low.

The argument presented in Jordan's paper highlights a critical issue in the current state of the medical system: the reliance on data analysis without sufficient attention to provenance. The author contends that the problem extends beyond individual medical care, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of where the data originates, the inferences drawn from it, and the relevance of those inferences to the present situation. The solution proposed involves the development of a new field of study at the intersection of data and humanities, emphasizing the importance of an engineering discipline with principles of analysis and design that goes beyond mere data-based decision-making.

The progress made in the past two decades, particularly in the realms of Intelligence Augmentation (IA) and Intelligent Infrastructure (II), provides a counterpoint to the limitations of human-imitative AI. The notion of IA involves using computation and data to enhance human intelligence and creativity, as exemplified by search engines and natural language translation. The emergence of Intelligent Infrastructure envisions a web of computation, data, and physical entities that makes human environments more supportive, interesting, and safe, extending into domains such as transportation, medicine, commerce, and finance.

However, the author introduces a critical perspective by asserting that success in domains like self-driving cars, which fall under the umbrella of II, is neither sufficient nor necessary to solve important IA and II problems. The complexity of engineering challenges in these domains, coupled with the potential distraction of focusing on human-imitative AI, suggests a cautious approach to letting data speak for itself. Moreover, the discussion prompts reflection on our ability as humans to train critical thinking AI when we ourselves may still lack in this aspect. The creation of AI and II systems, as portrayed in the article, becomes a reflection of human nature, prompting a reevaluation of the extent to which we should rely solely on data without incorporating higher cognitive and social understanding.

whats provenance
ChatGPT
Provenance refers to the origin or source of something, particularly in the context of information or data. In the field of data management and analysis, provenance is crucial for understanding the history, derivation, and transformations undergone by a piece of data. It involves tracking and documenting the entire lifecycle of data, including its creation, processing, and any changes or manipulations it undergoes.

Understanding the provenance of data is essential for ensuring its quality, reliability, and relevance in analytical or decision-making processes. It helps answer questions about where the data originated, how it was collected or generated, what transformations or analyses it has undergone, and how it has been used in different contexts over time. Provenance information adds transparency and accountability to data-driven activities, allowing users to assess the credibility and trustworthiness of the information they are working with.

does the article reflect on reconsidering why we shouldnt call it artificial intellignence?
ChatGPT
Yes, the article "Artificial Intelligence—The Revolution Hasn’t Happened Yet" does indeed reflect on the terminology used in the field. The author critiques the current public dialogue on artificial intelligence (AI) and argues that the term itself is often used as an intellectual wildcard, making it challenging to reason about the scope and consequences of emerging technology. The article delves into the historical perspectives of AI, particularly the original aspiration of realizing human-level intelligence in software and hardware. The author suggests that what is commonly labeled as AI today is, in fact, largely machine learning (ML), emphasizing the term's long-standing use in the field.

Furthermore, the article advocates for a more expansive view of the discipline, encompassing areas such as Intelligence Augmentation (IA) and Intelligent Infrastructure (II). The author proposes conceiving a new discipline, possibly labeled as a human-centric engineering discipline, to better capture the evolving nature of technology's impact on human life. By encouraging a reconsideration of terminology and framing the discussion in a broader context, the article prompts readers to move beyond the conventional understanding of AI and contemplate the societal and ethical implications of these evolving technologies.
